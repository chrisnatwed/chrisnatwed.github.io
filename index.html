                <section>

                    <p>First of all, welcome to the website for our wedding. The excitement even this far from the day is overwhelming to say the least. The count down is on:</p>

                    <span style="margin:0 auto;"><div class="clk"></div></span>

                    <p>I am so excited to marry Nat. We have been through quite a lot considering that we will only have been together for four and a half years by the date of the wedding.
                    The hardest thing by far is this year, the toughest of my life but I live it day to day knowing that on the ass end of this year I'll get to come home and marry the
                    girl of my dreams.</p>

                    <p>I can sit here and be mushy but lets face it thats not the sort of person I am. EVERYONE who is getting married says that they are perfect for whom they are marrying and
                    that they cannot imagine a life without their other half. Of course I feel those things, but cannot help but think of the 50% of people who are getting divorced these
                    days. I can get philosophical about this but the plain fact is that Nat and I are not like everyone else. Not many couples can do what Nat and I have done this year,
                    Nat has organised an entire wedding. Even though it kills her inside, she goes to events which I would usually be the one convincing her to go to. She does all that for
                    me and I want to use this chance to thank her, I'll make it up to you one day.</p>

                    <p>We literally talk on a daily basis, even about stuff which we would consider potentially boring. I stay up until 11:30pm (Nat gets home at 4:30pm so I wait to call) 
                    nightly to talk to Nat about the kids at school,
                    we make paper aeroplanes together, we are reading 1984 together and sometimes just spend time listening to the boring day to day things. It literally gets me through the
                    days. I constantly miss her but I know we will never take our time together for granted.</p>

                    <p>I can keep writing but I'm pretty sure that I will not have anything left for the wedding speech if I do so. So please look around the site, especially the section
                    on what people have done to make our wedding what it is.</p>

                    <p>Chris</p>
